## A note about the site

This site demonstrates how technical documentation can be easily maintained. Each page in the table of contents to the left is written in markdown, compiled via jekyll into a static page, and served on github pages. For comparison, the content currently served on [developer.laserfiche.com](https://developer.laserfiche.com) is pictured below.

Here is a table:

| column 1 | col 2 | col 3|
| --- | --- | --- |
| row1 | row1 | row1 |
| row2 | row2 | row2 |
| row3 | row3 | row3 |
| row4 | row4 | row4 |

Here is javascript snippet:
```js
function getName(i: int) {
    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i){
        console.log("hello, world");
    }
}
```
